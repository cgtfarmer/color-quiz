Scrape this site for the names and hex codes, make into JSON file
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp

Make tables with checkboxes for each set of colors

Do the simple ones only using ff/80 bytes for starts,

then slowly layer on more complex "real" colors with names from that site

Load up the JSON file with AJAX call, generate options tables and whatnot (I guess)

Then just randomly draw from selected body of colors - keep track of how many correct/incorrect since start of session
